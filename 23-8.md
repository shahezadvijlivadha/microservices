Assignment Question: Building a Microservice-Based Application with Node.js

Background:
You are tasked with developing a microservice-based application that manages a product catalog system and product-order system. The application should consist of two separate microservices: one for managing products and other for placing orders for those registered produscts.

Requirements:

1. Product Catalog Microservice:
-------------------------------
Develop first Node.js microservice that manages a product catalog. This microservice should offer the following features:
	a. Add products: Allow authenticated users to add new products to the catalog with details such as name, description, and price.
	b. List products: Provide an endpoint to list all products in the catalog.
	c. Get product details: Create an API to retrieve detailed information about a specific product by its ID.
	
2. Order Place Microservice:
------------------------------------
Implement another Node.js microservice responsible for order placing for above products. This microservice should provide the following functionalities:

Order Choose: Allow users to select products from product list.
Order Place and Display details: User can select one product from the Product List() and can place order with multiple quantity for that product.
Once the order is placed, display the product name and ordered quantity in the page.

Store Product data: Use an in-memory data store (e.g., an array) to store Product information.

3. Communication and Integration:
---------------------------------
Ensure communication between the two microservices using HTTP or an appropriate communication protocol. Each microservice should run independently and be accessible via API endpoints.
